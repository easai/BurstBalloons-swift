# BurstBalloons-swift

Sort the intervals by their end points. Start with the first intervalâ€™s end point as the target. For each interval, if its start point is greater than the current end point, increment the arrow count and update the end point. Otherwise, continue with the current arrow. This ensures the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons.
